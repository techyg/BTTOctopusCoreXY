This repository contains the printer.cfg file that I use with my BTT Octopus board, which is for a Core XY printer (originally based on a Hypercube Evolution):

300x300x400mm build volume
CoreXY kinematics
Linear Rails for X, Y
Dual Z
Optical Endstops for X, Y, Z (a BL Touch version is also available)
Hemera Extruder with hot end and part cooling fan
