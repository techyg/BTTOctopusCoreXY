This repository contains the printer.cfg file that I use with my BTT Octopus board, which is for a Core XY printer (originally based on a Hypercube Evolution):

- 300x300x400mm build volume
- CoreXY kinematics
- Linear Rails on X, Y with pulleys, using .9 degree motors 
- Dual Z, 1.8 degree motors
- Optical Endstops for X, Y, Z (a BL Touch version is also available)
- Hemera Extruder with hot end and part cooling fan
